## Overview
The goal of this project is to introduce the technology surrounding self-driving cars to a group of youth ages 14 and older, promoting education for autonomous technologies. In the workshop the focus is on automated lane recognition. Here, a distinction is made between self-learning models with high complexity and image-processing models. Self-learning models in this area are based, for example, on neural networks or special YOLO models of computer vision. Since these are highly mathematical models which are used in real vehicles, the simpler variant of image processing is used for the workshop.
The track detection by image processing elements is divided into the following areas:

- Programmatic image processing with OpenCV
- Lane detection
- Input image
- Greyscaling
- Brightness and Contrast
- Gaussian Blur
- Canny Edges
- Region of Interest
- Lane marking
- Slope
- Weighted Image
